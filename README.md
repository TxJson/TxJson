## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Who am I? :thought_balloon:

I am a 20 year old software developer currently living in Portsmouth, UK. I am originally from Sweden but I moved here to study for a Bachelors in Software Engineering and I am as of writing this, at the end of my first year and start of my second year. I have been programming for about 4 years using a multitude of languages, all of which you may find here on my Github Profile. I spent a majority of my time developing and designing games but my passion lies with developing software.
